                        Given a drawing, this program will use your web-cam to find the shapes you've drawn, then turn into
                        2D objects! You can click on them and they will fall and collide with your other drawings!

					Randomly generates a maze filled with "asteroids" and "gravity wells" and will find a path between
					two points using the A* search algorithm! It will show an animation of process of finding the path.
					You can even edit the map and the program will re-find the shortest path between the two points.

                        the program a regex pattern and each cell that matches it will be colored.

                        This is my first twitter bot! If you tweet at it with two images, it will re-create the second image
                        using only the pixels in the first image! Really cool effects are made and I love the results.

				<p>I have a little demo of one of my projects called photoquads</p>
				<p>It takes an image and, using a quad tree, it will split the image into rectangles depending on
				which node in the tree is the farthest from it's estimated average color.</p>

		<div class="about art">
			<h1 class="title">Randomly generated art</h1>
			<p>To say thanks for visiting! It may be ugly but it's yours.</p>
			<canvas id="canvas">
			</canvas>
			<p id="explanation">This "art" is created by simulating Conway's Game of life for a certain amount of cycles, each time a cell is to "die" or
            "be created" I increment a counter on that cell, which is used to refer to an index in an array of colors. At the end, I draw all the cells.
            Dead cells are filled with the color the cell is referring to, live cells are always black regardless of what
            color they refer to. This is the result of that!</p>
